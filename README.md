# mlsynth
This is the repository containing the code for the Python library mlsynth. I provide detailed tutorials for each estimator in the package. As of May 5, 2024, we have the two-step SCM, linking to my Forward DID package (which will someday be moved here and integrated), as well as the Principal Component Regression estimator.
