Sometimes with synthetic control methods, treated units are a little too extreme relative to their donor pool. As a result, analysts may sometimes need to use intecepts or relax the nonnegativiety constraint, but it's unclear, a priori, in which situations this is necessary or beneficial. The Two Step SCM is actually the only method in ``mlsynth`` that does not rely on machine-learning methods; it does, however, allow analysts to choose between these different modifications to SCM where it may be warranted. This is the benefit of the two-step synthetic control method, as detailed by Li and Shankar [TSSC]_.

Here, we have :math:`\mathcal{N} \operatorname*{:=} \lbrace{1 \ldots N \rbrace}` units across :math:`t \in \left(1, T\right) \cap \mathbb{N}` time periods, where :math:`j=1` is our sole treated unit. This leaves us with :math:`\mathcal{N}_{0} \operatorname*{:=} \lbrace{2 \ldots N\rbrace}` control units, with the cardinality of this set being the number of controls. We have two sets of time series :math:`\mathcal{T} \operatorname*{:=} \mathcal{T}_{0} \cup \mathcal{T}_{1}`, where :math:`\mathcal{T}_{0} \operatorname*{:=}  \lbrace{1\ldots T_0 \rbrace}` is the pre-intervention period and :math:`\mathcal{T}_{1} \operatorname*{:=} \lbrace{T_0+1\ldots T \rbrace}` denotes the post-intervention period, each with their respective cardinalities. Let :math:`\mathbf{w} \operatorname*{:=} \lbrace{w_2 \ldots w_N  \rbrace}` be a generic weight vector we assign to untreated units. We observe

.. math::
    y_{jt} = 
    \begin{cases}
        y^{0}_{jt} & \forall \: j\in \mathcal{N}_0\\
        y^{0}_{1t} & \text{if } j = 1 \text{ and } t \in \mathcal{T}_0 \\
        y^{1}_{1t} & \text{if } j = 1 \text{ and } t \in \mathcal{T}_1
    \end{cases}

We have a single treated unit which, along with the donors, follows a certain data generating process for all time periods until :math:`T_0`. Afterwards, the control units follow the same process. The change of the outcomes :math:`j=1,  \forall t \in \mathcal{T}_1` is whatever that process was, plus some treatment effect. To this end, we are concerned with :math:`\hat{y}_{j1}`, or the values we would have observed absent treatment. The statistic we are concerned with is the average treatment effect on the treated

.. math::
    ATT = \frac{1}{T_1 - T_0} \sum_{T_0 +1}^{T} (y_{1t} - \hat{y}_{1t})

where :math:`(y_{1t} - \hat{y}_{1t})` is the treatment effect.


I presume the reader is familiar with the basic idea of syntethic control methods: a linear and most often convex combinaiton of controls should approximate the outcome trajectory of a treated unit in the pre=intervention period. Consider three modifications to this idea, though, call them Modified Synthetic Controls (MSC).

MSCa
-----
.. math::

    \underset{w}{\text{argmin}} & \quad ||\mathbf{y}_{1} - \mathbf{Y}_{\mathcal{N}_{0}}w_{j}, - \mathbf{\beta}||_{2}^2 \\
    \text{s.t.} \: & \mathbf{w}: w_{j} \in \mathbb{I}, \quad  {\| \mathbf{w} \|_{1} = 1}, \mathbf{\beta} \neq 0.

Where :math:`\mathbb{I}` is the unit interval.  MSCa shifts the counterfactual within the convex hull using the :math:`T \times 1` vector of 1s with its corresponding coefficient being :math:`\mathbf{\beta}` (which is unconstrained). It is the intercept.

MSCb
-----
.. math::

    \underset{w}{\text{argmin}} & \quad ||\mathbf{y}_{1} - \mathbf{Y}_{\mathcal{N}_{0}}w_{j}||_{2}^2 \\
    \text{s.t.} \: & \mathbf{w}: w_{j} \in \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}

MSCb gets rid of the intercept and forces the weights to only be positive.

MSCc
-----
.. math::

    \underset{w}{\text{argmin}} & \quad ||\mathbf{y}_{1} - \mathbf{Y}_{\mathcal{N}_{0}}w_{j}-\mathbf{\beta}]||_{2}^2 \\
    \text{s.t.} \: & \mathbf{w}: w_{j} \in \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}

MSCc allows for both an intercept and unrestricted positive weights. We now are projecting the treated unit (as with MSCb) onto a convex cone, instead of the convex hull. We typically would want to use these latter estimators if the treated unit has a particularly higher slope or trend compared to the donor units. Given these different options, it makes sense for analysts to care about which set of restrictions are the most plausible. If a convex combination is enough, then we simply use SC as it was originally formulated. If not, we must select the proper set of constraints to use.

Step 1: Testing the Relevant Hypotheses
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The point of TSSC is to first test the viability of the parallel pre-trends assumption for vanilla SCM, which chooses between the original model and the other three presented. Precisely, we make a null hypothesis

.. math::

    H_0 : w_{j} \in \mathbb{I}, \quad  {\| \mathbf{w} \|_{1} = 1}

or, that we've violated the pre-intervention trend convex hull restriction. In order to test this null hypothesis, we use subsampling (see Kathy's original paper for details) to test the convex SCM's pre-intervention fit against MSCc's. The reason MSCc is the benchmark is because if the intercept is 0 (even though we've constrained it not to be) and the unit weights add up to 1 (even though they need not), MSCc reduces to vanilla SCM.

We first test a joint null hypothesis. We may write our null hypothesis as :math:`H_0 : \mu = 0, \quad   {||\mathbf{w}||_{1} = 1}`, or, :math:`\mathbf R\beta_0 - \mathbf q=\mathbf{0}_{2}`, or in words, that the intercept is 0 and the unit weights should add to 1. :math:`\mathbf R` is a matrix where the first and second rows of the first column are 0 and 1 respectively with the latter columns being 1 and 0 respectively.

.. math::

    \left(
    \begin{bmatrix}
        0 & \mathbf{1}^{\top}_{N-1} \\
        1 & \mathbf{0}^{\top}_{N-1}.
    \end{bmatrix}
    \right)

:math:`\mathbf q` is a vector to be used in the joint null hypothesis test

.. math::

    \begin{bmatrix}
        1 \\
        0
    \end{bmatrix}

The top row of :math:`\mathbf{R}` corresponds to the summation to one constraint and the lower row of :math:`\mathbf{R}` corresponds to the zero intercept. We can use :math:`\mathbf{R}` and :math:`\mathbf{q}` to define a vector, :math:`\mathbf{d}`, to test the null hypothesis: :math:`\mathbf{d} = \mathbf{R} \mathbf{w} - \mathbf{q}`. :math:`\mathbf{d}` is a 2 by 1 vector, with the first element corresponding to the sum of the weights and the second element being the value of the intercept generated by MSCc. We then use :math:`\mathbf{d} T_0` to derive the test statistic

.. math::

    \tilde{S}_{T_1}= (\sqrt{T_0}\mathbf{d} )\hat{V}^{-1} (\sqrt{T_0}\mathbf{d})

where :math:`V` is the asymptotic variance of :math:`\sqrt{T_1}\mathbf{R}(\hat{\mathbf{w}}_{T_0}^{\text{MSC}}-\mathbf{w}_{T_0}^{\text{MSC}})`. The natural issue, then, is how to estimate the variance. To do this, we can use a subsampling routine. We begin by taking random draws of the pre-intervention period :math:`m=1 \ldots T_0` for both the treated and control units and estimate the synthetic control :math:`\hat{\mathbf{w}}_{T_0}^{\text{MSC}}`, checking its differences versus the original weights :math:`\mathbf{w}_{T_0}^{\text{MSC}}`. We repeat this process many times (10000 in this case). We can then get a consistent estimator of the variance

.. math::

    \hat{V} = \mathbf{R}\sigma^{\ast}(\sqrt{T_0}\hat{\mathbf{w}}_{T_0}^{\text{MSC}})\mathbf{R}^{\top}

where :math:`\sigma^{\ast}(\sqrt{T_0}\hat{\mathbf{w}}_{T_0}^{\text{MSC}})` is

.. math::

    \frac{m}{B} \sum_{b=1}^{B}(\hat{\mathbf{w}}_{T_0}^{\text{MSC,m,b}}-\mathbf{w}_{T_0}^{\text{MSC}})(\hat{\mathbf{w}}_{T_0}^{\text{MSC,m,b}}-\mathbf{w}_{T_0}^{\text{MSC}})^{\top}

with :math:`b` being the number of draws. The sub-sampling statistic itself is

.. math::

    S^{\ast}_{m,b} = (\sqrt{m}(\hat{\mathbf{w}}_{T_0}^{\text{MSC,m,b}}-\mathbf{w}_{T_0}^{\text{MSC}})^{\top})\mathbf{V}^{-1} (\sqrt{m}(\hat{\mathbf{w}}_{T_0}^{\text{MSC,m,b}}-\mathbf{w}_{T_0}^{\text{MSC}}))

and, after sorting these in ascending order, the confidence interval is :math:`[\hat{S}_{m,(\alpha B/2)}, \hat{S}_{m,((1-\alpha/2)B)}]`. Should :math:`\tilde{S}_{T_1}` fall within the confidence interval, we reject the joint null hypothesis. If this fails, we then proceed to test the summing to 1 and intercept constraints individually. For each, we make null hypotheses using the row vectors of :math:`\mathbf{R}` above, with the respective nulls for summation and the zero intercept being :math:`H_{0_{a}} : \| \mathbf{w} \| = 1` and :math:`H_{0_{b}} : \mu = 0`. For each, we can write them as :math:`\mathbf{R}_{a} \mathbf{w}^{\text{MSC}} - \mathbf{q}_{a}` and :math:`\mathbf{R}_{b} \mathbf{w}^{\text{MSC}} - \mathbf{q}_{b}`. For summation and the intercept respectively, :math:`\mathbf{q}_a = 1` and :math:`\mathbf{q}_b = 0`, with :math:`\mathbf{R}_a = (0, \mathbf{1}_{N-1}^{\top})` and :math:`\mathbf{R}_b = (0, \mathbf{0}_{N-1}^{\top})`. For each null hypothesis, our test statistic is :math:`(\sqrt{T_0} \mathbf{d})^{2}`, where for nulls :math:`s = a, b` we compute :math:`\mathbf{d} = \mathbf{R}_s \hat{\mathbf{w}}_{T_0}^{\text{MSC}} - \mathbf{q}_s`. We also use the subsampling procedure I just described to calculate the subsampling statistics and confidence intervals. TSSC proceeds sequentially. If the joint null is violated, we then first test the summation constraint. If we fail to reject summation, we use MSCa and include the intercept. If we reject, we then test the intercept constraint. If we fail to reject, we use MSCb since it does not impose the summation constraint and does not use the intercept. If the intercept null is also invalid, we use MSCc, the most flexible SCM listed here as it uses both an intercept and unconstrained positive donor weights.

Step 2: Estimation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After we choose the correct set of constraints, we then estimate the counterfactual. Below, I use TSSC in the provided empirical application. Suppose an online retailer opens a showroom in Brooklyn, and we have 10 donors to choose from. A plot for this is below (note that I don't know the names of the donors, but it doesn't matter what their names are). The black line is the sales trends for Brooklyn, and the blue lines are the donor trends. The red dashed line is the treatment point, or :math:`t = 76`.

Here, we can get a sense of how the quasi-experiment may be set up, where we have the sole treated unit as Brooklyn, and :math:`N_0 = 10`. In our case, MSC(b) is the counterfactual of interest as it was the one selected by the first step. Modified SCM(b) gets a pretreatment RMSE of 434.43. Its absolute and percentage ATTs are 1131.97 and 24.5.
