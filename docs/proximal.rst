Proximal Synthetic Control
==========================

Next, I discuss the proximal SCM method. In synthetic control methods, we oftentimes make the presumption that our outcomes are generated by some latent variable model, :math:`y_{jt} = \delta_t + \lambda_t\mu_j+\epsilon_{jt}`. This data-generating process may include covariates, but the basic idea is that there are a set of common time effects which impact all units the same and unit-specific effects, which interact with the former, which generates the outcomes that we see we see. Abadie and co [ABADIE2010]_ and others ues this linear factor model to justify SCM. They also derive a bias boud for the SCM, which is (with qualifications) unbiased as the the number of pre-treatment periods grows without bound. This, naturally, poses a problem in settings where we have few pre-treatment periods. Additionally, it may not always be possible to obtain good pre-treatment fit, even if we are mathching on the time-variant factors by regressing our treated unit's outcomes upon our donor units. As a result, the Proximal Inference SCM was developed. In the paper, Shi, Li, Miao, Hu, and Tchetgen Tchetgen [ProxSCM]_



   argue that the outcomes of control units are essentially proxies of the latent factors. Rather than directly regressing the outcome on all such proxies, one can split the set of  proxies into two, thus leveraging one set of proxies to assist the construction of a SC defined in terms of the other set of proxies.


In other words, if we agree that the outcomes of the control units are time variant proxies for our control units, we may be able to still employ the outcomes of other control units, repurposing them for matching on the latent time variant factors instead of learning the weights. This page describes, broadly, the three methods they propose, and applies it to an emprical example.

Notations
----------


This method is a GMM based estimator of the treatment effect, where some units are used as surrogates (or, predictive of the latent unit specific factors which drive the outcome) and proxies, unaffected elements that vary through time and match on the time latent common factors.

Estimating Proximal SCM via ``mlsynth``
--------------------------------------------


This is the plot we get when we estimate the causal impact.

As we can see, even when we use only post-intervention data to estimate the causal impact, the result largely agrees with the original estimates.
