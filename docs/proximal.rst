Proximal Synthetic Control
==========================

Next, I discuss the proximal SCM method. In synthetic control methods, we oftentimes make the presumption that our outcomes are generated by some latent variable model, :math:`y_{jt} = \delta_t + \lambda_t\mu_j+\epsilon_{jt}`. This data-generating process may include covariates, but the basic idea is that there are a set of common time effects which impact all units the same and unit-specific effects, which interact with the former, which generates the outcomes that we see we see. Abadie and co [ABADIE2010]_ and others ues this linear factor model to justify SCM. They also derive a bias boud for the SCM, which is (with qualifications) unbiased as the the number of pre-treatment periods grows without bound. This, naturally, poses a problem in settings where we have few pre-treatment periods. Additionally, it may not always be possible to obtain good pre-treatment fit, even if we are mathching on the time-variant factors by regressing our treated unit's outcomes upon our donor units. As a result, the Proximal Inference SCM was developed. In the paper, Shi, Li, Miao, Hu, and Tchetgen Tchetgen [ProxSCM]_



   argue that the outcomes of control units are essentially proxies of the latent factors. Rather than directly regressing the outcome on all such proxies, one can split the set of  proxies into two, thus leveraging one set of proxies to assist the construction of a SC defined in terms of the other set of proxies.


In other words, if we agree that the outcomes of the control units are time variant proxies for our control units, we may be able to still employ the outcomes of other control units, repurposing them for matching on the latent time variant factors instead of learning the weights. This page describes, broadly, the three methods they propose, and applies it to an emprical example.

Notations
----------

Formally, let us define the notation. We observe a set of units indexed by :math:`j`, where 
:math:`\mathcal{N} \operatorname*{:=} \{1, 2, \ldots, N\}` is the set of all units, with cardinality 
:math:`N = |\mathcal{N}|`. Let :math:`j = 1` represent the treated unit, and 
:math:`\mathcal{N}_0 \operatorname*{:=} \mathcal{N} \setminus \{1\}` denote the set of control units, 
with cardinality :math:`N_0 = |\mathcal{N}_0|`. The time periods are indexed by :math:`t`, with 
:math:`\mathcal{T}_1 \operatorname*{:=} \{1, 2, \ldots, T_0\}` representing the pre-intervention periods 
and :math:`\mathcal{T}_2 \operatorname*{:=} \{T_0 + 1, \ldots, T\}` representing the post-intervention periods. 
We denote the full time series as :math:`\mathcal{T} \operatorname*{:=} \mathcal{T}_1 \cup \mathcal{T}_2`, 
with :math:`T = |\mathcal{T}|` representing the total number of time periods.

Let :math:`\mathbf{y}_1 \in \mathbb{R}^T` be the vector for the treated unit's outcomes, and 
:math:`\mathbf{Y}_0 \in \mathbb{R}^{T \times N_0}` be the matrix containing the outcomes of the control units. 
Let :math:`\mathbf{P}_t \in \mathbb{R}^{k \times T}` be a matrix of proxy variables that are assumed to be 
correlated with the common factors driving the outcomes of the treated unit. Here, :math:`k` represents the 
number of proxy variables, and :math:`T` is the number of time periods.

Let :math:`\mathbf{w} \in \mathbb{R}^{N_0}` represent the vector of weights that defines the synthetic control, 
and we seek to minimize the difference between the treated unit's outcome and the linear combination of the 
control units' outcomes weighted by :math:`\mathbf{w}`.

We define the estimating function for the proximal synthetic control method as:

.. math::

    U_t(\mathbf{w}) = g(\mathbf{P}_t) \cdot \left( \mathbf{y}_t - (\mathbf{Y}_0 \mathbf{w})_t \right),

where :math:`g(\mathbf{P}_t)` is a function applied to the proxy variables :math:`\mathbf{P}_t` at time :math:`t`, 
and :math:`\mathbf{y}_t` and :math:`(\mathbf{Y}_0 \mathbf{w})_t` are the observed and predicted outcomes at time 
:math:`t`, respectively.

The goal is to estimate the weights :math:`\mathbf{w}` by minimizing the quadratic form of the weighted estimating 
functions over time:

.. math::

    \mathbf{w} = \arg\min_{\mathbf{w}} \sum_{t \in \mathcal{T}_1} U_t(\mathbf{w})^\top \Omega^{-1} U_t(\mathbf{w}),

where :math:`\Omega` is the covariance matrix of the estimating function.

To calculate the Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATT), we take the weighted sum of the control units' 
outcomes based on the estimated :math:`\mathbf{w}`:

To calculate the Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATT), we take the weighted sum of the control units' 
outcomes based on the estimated :math:`\mathbf{w}`:

.. math::

    \tau = \mathbf{y}_1 - \mathbf{Y}_0 \mathbf{w}.

Thus, the ATT is the difference between the treated unit's observed outcome :math:`\mathbf{y}_1` and the synthetic 
control, which is a linear combination of the control units' outcomes weighted by :math:`\mathbf{w}`.

Inference
----------

To compute inference, we first estimate the variance-covariance matrix of the moment conditions, denoted by 
:math:`\boldsymbol{\Omega}`. This is done using a HAC (heteroskedasticity- and autocorrelation-consistent) estimator. 
The matrix :math:`\boldsymbol{\Omega}` is computed as:

.. math::

    \boldsymbol{\Omega} = \frac{1}{T} \sum_{j=-J}^{J} k(j, J) \sum_{t=1}^{T - |j|} \mathbf{g}_t \mathbf{g}_{t+j}^\top,

where :math:`k(j, J)` is the kernel function (e.g., Bartlett kernel), :math:`J` is the bandwidth, and 
:math:`\mathbf{g}_t` is the vector of moment conditions at time :math:`t`. The outer summation runs over all lags 
within the valid range, while the inner summation computes the covariance contribution for each lag.

Using :math:`\boldsymbol{\Omega}` and the Jacobian matrix :math:`\mathbf{G}`, we calculate the covariance matrix 
of the parameters as:

.. math::

    \text{Cov} = \mathbf{G}^{-1} \boldsymbol{\Omega} \left(\mathbf{G}^{-1}\right)^\top,

where :math:`\mathbf{G}` is the Jacobian of the moment conditions with respect to the parameters 
:math:`\boldsymbol{\alpha}` and :math:`\tau`.

The variance of the ATT estimate :math:`\tau` is then extracted from the covariance matrix as:

.. math::

    \text{Var}(\tau) = \text{Cov}[-1, -1],

where :math:`\text{Cov}[-1, -1]` refers to the bottom-right entry of the covariance matrix. Finally, the standard error 
of :math:`\tau` is computed as:

.. math::

    \text{SE}(\tau) = \sqrt{\frac{\text{Var}(\tau)}{T}}.

Estimating Proximal SCM via ``mlsynth``
--------------------------------------------


This is the plot we get when we estimate the causal impact.

As we can see, even when we use only post-intervention data to estimate the causal impact, the result largely agrees with the original estimates.
