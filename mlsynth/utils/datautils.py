    """Clean surrogate variables by orthogonalizing them against covariates.

    This function adjusts each surrogate variable in `surrogate_matrix` by removing the
    linear influence of a set of covariates. The covariates for projection
    are formed by combining `donor_covariates_matrix` (donor pool covariates) and
    `treated_unit_covariates_matrix` (treated unit covariates), potentially augmented by
    `common_covariates_matrix`. The cleaning process involves estimating a linear
    relationship between each surrogate and the combined covariates using data
    from the pre-treatment period (`num_pre_treatment_periods`), and then
    subtracting this predicted component from the surrogate across all time periods.

        Matrix of covariates for the treated unit.

        Typically, `n_donor_covariates` equals `n_treated_covariates`.
    num_pre_treatment_periods : int
        Number of pre-treatment periods. The linear projection coefficients
        (`projection_coefficients`) are estimated using data up to this period.
    common_covariates_matrix : Optional[np.ndarray], default None

    This function takes a long-format DataFrame and pivots it to create
    two wide-format matrices for a specified set of surrogate units:
    1.  A surrogate matrix (often denoted as `X` in models like ProximalSC),
        derived from variables specified by `proxy_variable_column_names_map['donorproxies']`.
    2.  A surrogate-proxy matrix (often denoted `Z1`), derived from variables

    in `df` to be used for constructing these matrices.

    Parameters
    ----------
    df : pd.DataFrame

        A dictionary specifying the variables to use for constructing the

          to use for the surrogate-proxy matrix.
    unit_id_column_name : str, default "Artist"
        Name of the column in `df` that identifies unique units. (Formerly `id_col`)
    time_period_column_name : str, default "Date"
        Name of the column in `df` that identifies time periods. This column

    num_total_periods : Optional[int], default None
        Total number of time periods. This parameter is not explicitly used in
