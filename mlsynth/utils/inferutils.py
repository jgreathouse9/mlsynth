    """Perform model selection for Two-Step Synthetic Control (TSSC) via bootstrapping.

    This function implements a hypothesis testing procedure based on bootstrapping
    to recommend one of four synthetic control model specifications:
    - "MSCc": Most general model (unrestricted).
    - "MSCa": Model with restriction H0a imposed (e.g., sum of weights is 1).
    - "MSCb": Model with restriction H0b imposed (e.g., intercept is 0).
    - "SC": Standard Synthetic Control (both H0a and H0b imposed).

    The selection is based on p-values derived from comparing test statistics
    (related to the restrictions) against their bootstrapped distributions.

    Parameters
    ----------
    restriction_matrix_h0a : np.ndarray
        Restriction matrix for hypothesis H0a. Shape (n_restr_a, n_coeffs),
        where n_restr_a is the number of restrictions in H0a and n_coeffs
        is the number of coefficients in the MSCc model.
        Example: `restriction_matrix_h0a @ msc_c_coefficients_initial = target_values_h0a`.
    restriction_matrix_h0b : np.ndarray
        Restriction matrix for hypothesis H0b. Shape (n_restr_b, n_coeffs).
        Example: `restriction_matrix_h0b @ msc_c_coefficients_initial = target_values_h0b`.
    combined_restriction_matrix_h0 : np.ndarray
        Combined restriction matrix for the joint hypothesis H0 (H0a and H0b).
        Shape (n_restr_a + n_restr_b, n_coeffs).
        Example: `combined_restriction_matrix_h0 @ msc_c_coefficients_initial = target_values_h0_combined`.
    msc_c_coefficients_initial : np.ndarray
        Coefficient vector from the initially fitted, unrestricted MSCc model.
        Shape (n_coeffs,).
    target_values_h0a : Union[float, np.ndarray]
        Target value(s) for restriction H0a. Shape (n_restr_a,).
    target_values_h0b : Union[float, np.ndarray]
        Target value(s) for restriction H0b. Shape (n_restr_b,).
    target_values_h0_combined : Union[float, np.ndarray]
        Target value(s) for the joint restriction H0. Shape (n_restr_a + n_restr_b,).
    num_pre_treatment_periods : int
        Number of pre-treatment periods used for estimation.
    donor_predictors_pre_treatment : np.ndarray
        Pre-treatment donor matrix (predictors). Shape (num_pre_treatment_periods, n_features),
        where n_features is the number of predictor variables (e.g., donor outcomes,
        potentially including an intercept column).
    treated_outcome_pre_treatment : np.ndarray
        Pre-treatment outcome vector for the treated unit. Shape (num_pre_treatment_periods,).
    num_bootstrap_replications : int
        Number of bootstrap replications to perform.
    num_model_coefficients : int
        Total number of coefficients in the MSCc model (n_coeffs). This should
        match `donor_predictors_pre_treatment.shape[1]` if `donor_predictors_pre_treatment`
        includes an intercept, or `donor_predictors_pre_treatment.shape[1] + 1`
        if the intercept is handled separately by `lsq_linear` but included in
        `msc_c_coefficients_initial`. Typically, this is `donor_predictors_pre_treatment.shape[1]`.
    bootstrapped_msc_c_coefficients_array : np.ndarray
        A pre-allocated array to store the bootstrapped coefficient vectors.
        Shape (n_coeffs, num_bootstrap_replications). This array will be modified in-place.

    Returns
    -------
    str
        The name of the recommended synthetic control model: "MSCc", "MSCa",
        "MSCb", or "SC".

    Notes
    -----
    - The core of the procedure involves bootstrapping residuals from the MSCc model
      to generate `num_bootstrap_replications` bootstrapped coefficient vectors.
    - For each bootstrapped sample, test statistics related to H0a, H0b, and H0
      are computed.
    - P-values (p_value_joint_test, p_value_h0a_test, p_value_h0b_test) are calculated
      by comparing the original test statistics to the distribution of bootstrapped
      test statistics.
    - Decision logic:
        - If p_value_joint_test >= 0.05 (cannot reject joint H0): recommend "MSCc".
        - Else if p_value_h0a_test >= 0.05 and p_value_h0b_test >= 0.05 (cannot reject H0a and H0b individually,
          despite rejecting joint H0 - this case might indicate issues with joint test power
          or complex interactions, original paper logic leads to "MSCa"): recommend "MSCa".
        - Else if p_value_h0a_test < 0.05 or p_value_h0b_test < 0.05 (at least one individual restriction is rejected):
          recommend "MSCb" (this implies if H0a is rejected, H0b might hold, or vice-versa.
          The original paper's logic seems to prioritize testing individual restrictions
          if the joint one is rejected).
        - Else (p_value_joint_test < 0.05, p_value_h0a_test < 0.05, p_value_h0b_test < 0.05 - all rejected): recommend "SC".
    - The function uses `scipy.optimize.lsq_linear` for constrained least squares
      estimation within the bootstrap loop, typically assuming non-negativity for
      weights and an unconstrained intercept.

    """Construct agnostic conformal prediction intervals.

    Generates prediction intervals for post-treatment predictions based on
    pre-treatment residuals and assuming residuals follow a distribution
    for which sub-Gaussian concentration bounds apply. The interval width
    is determined by the variability of pre-treatment residuals and the
    desired coverage level `miscoverage_rate`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    actual_outcomes_pre_treatment : np.ndarray
        Actual pre-treatment outcomes. Shape (T_pre,), where T_pre is the
        number of pre-treatment periods.
    predicted_outcomes_pre_treatment : np.ndarray
        Predicted pre-treatment outcomes, corresponding to `actual_outcomes_pre_treatment`.
        Shape (T_pre,). Must have the same length as `actual_outcomes_pre_treatment`.
    predicted_outcomes_post_treatment : np.ndarray
        Predicted post-treatment outcomes for which intervals are desired.
        Shape (T_post,), where T_post is the number of post-treatment periods.
    miscoverage_rate : float, optional
        Desired miscoverage level (e.g., 0.1 for 90% prediction intervals,
        meaning (1-miscoverage_rate) coverage). Must be between 0 and 1. Default is 0.1.
    pad_value : Any, optional
        Value used to pad the pre-treatment portion of the returned interval
        arrays. This makes the output arrays align with a full time series
        (pre- and post-treatment). Default is `np.nan`.

    Returns
    -------
    Tuple[np.ndarray, np.ndarray]
        A tuple containing:
        - lower_bounds_full_series : np.ndarray
            Lower bounds of the prediction intervals. Shape (T_pre + T_post,).
            The first T_pre elements are filled with `pad_value`.
        - upper_bounds_full_series : np.ndarray
            Upper bounds of the prediction intervals. Shape (T_pre + T_post,).
            The first T_pre elements are filled with `pad_value`.

    Raises
    ------
    MlsynthDataError
        If `actual_outcomes_pre_treatment` and `predicted_outcomes_pre_treatment` have different lengths.
        If `actual_outcomes_pre_treatment` is empty.
    MlsynthConfigError
        If `miscoverage_rate` is not between 0 and 1.
